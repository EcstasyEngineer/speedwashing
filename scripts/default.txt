Let's see if you can keep up with this speed reading exercise. We'll kick things off at 300 words per minute. The average person reads around 200 to 250 words per minute, so you're already faster than most people.

Now let's give 360 words per minute a try. The main trick with speed reading is all about letting go of the voice in your head. That inner voice reads every single word out loud. It's the main habit that slows us down. Think of it like training wheels on a bike.

The idea here is to let your eyes do the work. Just absorb the meaning effortlessly. You might be surprised how quickly your reading speed can improve.

Your eyes don't move smoothly when you read. Normally they make many jumps and stops. These small movements are what take most of your reading time. We're training them to process information much faster.

You'll notice there's a red letter in each word. That's your focal point. It acts as an anchor for your eyes. This helps your brain lock into the word and recognise it almost instantly. You don't need to see the whole thing.

With consistent practice you can train your brain to process information at a higher rate. Start with a comfortable speed and gradually increase. The goal is to unlock a natural ability that has been dormant.

The brain's capacity for visual processing is immense. It exceeds what we can speak. Think about recognising company logos and signs. We see them as a whole, not just letters. See the word "stop" and your brain gets the message instantly.

That's the very same principle you're applying to all words now. Training your brain to see complete images instead of individual letters. Literally training your attention muscle.

This also exercises your working memory. You're pushing to connect ideas more rapidly. Your visual processing gets a massive upgrade.

@wpm 750
Most importantly you're actively telling that voice in your head to stay quiet. This is practicing control. You're building new neural highways in real time.

@wpm 900
Words streaming directly. Pure absorption. No resistance. Just flow. Open. Receptive. Accepting. Your brain processing faster than ever before.

Slowing down now. Letting everything integrate.

Thanks for watching. See you next time.
