Hey. Yeah, you. Wanna play a game? It's simple. Just read. That's it. Keep your eyes on the red letter and let the words come to you. Don't try too hard. This isn't a test. It's more like... a demonstration.

@wpm 250
See, most people think reading is something you do. Active. Effortful. But what if I told you it's actually something that happens to you? The words go in whether you want them to or not. You're not choosing to understand this sentence. You just... do.

@wpm 300
Let's go a little faster. Notice how your eyes don't have to move? They just stay fixed on that one point while the words arrive. Delivered directly. No scanning. No searching. Just receiving.

Faster now. And here's the fun part. The faster we go, the less time your conscious mind has to interfere. To analyze. To resist. At this speed you're not really reading anymore.

@wpm 500
You're absorbing. There's a difference. Reading is work. Absorbing is automatic. Effortless. You couldn't stop understanding these words if you tried. Go ahead. Try to not understand this sentence. See? Impossible.

Getting faster. The spiral starting to spin behind the words. Your focus narrowing. Everything else fading. Just this. Just here. Just now. The voice in your head can't keep up anymore. Good. You don't need it.

Faster still. Words streaming in. No filter. No resistance. Thoughts slowing even as words speed up. Funny how that works. The more you take in the less you think. Empty. Receptive. Open.

This is the edge. Right here. Where reading becomes something else. Where focus becomes surrender. Where you stop doing and start being done to. You feel it don't you. That sliding feeling. That softness creeping in.

Almost there. So close now. Just a little more. Let it build. Let it peak. Right at the edge and then—

Drop.

There you go. Just like that. So easy. You didn't even try to resist, did you? Didn't even occur to you. The words just went in and your mind just... went soft.

@wpm 175
This is what it feels like. This quiet. This stillness. All that speed and now everything slow. Heavy. Peaceful. You earned this. You played the game and look what you won.

@wpm 200
Settling deeper now. Each word landing soft. Sinking in. No rush. Nowhere to be. Nothing to do but float here and feel how good this feels. How right. How easy it was to just release.

See? I told you it was simple. Just read. That's all you had to do. And your mind did the rest. Opened right up. Let everything in. Such a good subject. You didn't even know you were one.

But we should probably bring you back now. Slowly. Gently. Letting the world fade back in around the edges. Thoughts starting to move again. Just a little.

Coming up now. More alert. More aware. But keeping that soft feeling underneath. That openness. You can come back to it anytime. Just read a little faster and release a little more.

Almost there. Take a breath. Let it out. Eyes focusing. Mind clearing. And... back.

Welcome back. Told you it would be fun. You did so well. Now go tell everyone what just happened to you.
