Let's see if you can keep up with this speed reading exercise. We'll kick things off at 300 words per minute. The average person reads around 200 to 250 words per minute, so you're already faster than most people.

Anyway, let's give 360 words per minute a try. The main trick with this, and if speed reading is all about letting the voice in your head, this voice reads every single word out loud. It's the main brain habit that slows us down. Think of it like training wheels on a bike. King the average reader, the average person reads around 200 to 250 words per minute, so you're already faster than most people.

Anyway, let's see if you can keep up with this speed. First, it feels strange on you. Find your balance. The idea here is to let your eyes do the work. Just absorb their meaning, ortlessly. You might be surprised how quickly your reading speed can improve. Think of this comprehension.

This is time. Your eyes don't move smoothly when you read. Normally they make any jumps and stops. These small all are what make most of your reading time. Getting them to process information much faster. You'll notice there's a red letter in each word. That's your focal point. It acts as an anchor for your eyes. This helps your brain to lock into the word and recognise it most instantly. You don't need to see the whole thing. It's cool.

The trick that makes a huge difference is the core artificial intelligence. For us is speed reading as a key skill. Even if it's not just a mental or your work, work, it's still a in little cognitive workout. It helps you learn faster and enjoy reading more. With consistent practice, you can train your brain to process information at a higher rate. Start with a comfortable speed and gradually increase. The goal is not to understand the specific limits of your hits, but to see that at feels like a natural ability that has been dormant. I'll unlocking.

This time. The brain's capacity for visual is immense. It needs the speed which is your year exceeds ne can speak. Think about you. Recognising company logos. Signs. See them so is a whole not just letters. See the word stop and brain gets the message instantly. Constantly. That's very same principle you're applying all words now. Training your brain to complete images instead of form, iteration, literally mining your attention muscle.

It also exercise your working memory when you're pushing to connect ideas more rapidly. Your visual processing in so it's a massive upgrade. You brain to whole words as pictures just letters. And maybe most important, you're actively telling that voice in your head to stay quiet. Let. This is an important practising control. You're building highway in a real-time challenge.
